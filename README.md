# Hello there 👋


## Who am I?

### I’m a first-year student at a French computer science school called [Coda](https://www.coda.school/). Currently I am working thowards getting my Bachelor's degree in Fullstack developpment, to achieve that goal I work on multiple projects, whether it be school work or personnal projects, you will find it all here. I welcome all help or criticism on any of my repositories, I am always willing to learn new things.

## what I like to do.

### I like to mess around with anything related to micro controllers, and coding. Most of my projects will include anything I find funny, or that helps simplify my workflow (template libraries, arduino, esp32, linux ricing, game libraries...). I also love learning new tools, or languages to make my projects more complex and consequently more fun, I have also started learning reverse engineering to be able to understand code more fluidly. In my free time I also do art and painting comissions for table top games/wargames, I have linked my Instagram in case anyone would want to either commission me or offer/ask for tips and critiques.
